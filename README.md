# affil-a-friend
Extension for Chrome, Firefox, IE using the Crossrider framework. Don't ever forget to support your favorite podcast/blogger/website again!


DISCLAIMER: The source code that I've written is published here, but compiling a runnable version of the extension from it is pretty well out of the question due to the way in which Crossrider hosts/serves the project code.

The following link should detect your browser and allow you to download/install Affil-a-friend in Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer, BUT it will definitely trigger your browser's "END OF THE WORLD MALWARE" alarm:
