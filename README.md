# affil-a-friend
Extension for Chrome, Firefox, IE using the Crossrider framework. Don't ever forget to support your favorite podcast/blogger/website again!


DISCLAIMER: The source code that I've written is published here, but compiling a runnable version of the extension from it is pretty well out of the question due to the way in which Crossrider hosts/serves the project code.

The following link should detect your browser and allow you to download Affil-a-friend for Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer, BUT it will definitely trigger your browser's "END OF THE WORLD MALWARE" alarm:

#Install
##Chrome

Chrome won’t let you directly install the .crx file that you get through the download link, but it will let you install it manually by jumping through a few hoops:

1.	Download the .crx extension file.
2.	Unpack it with your archive management program of choice (7-Zip, WinRAR, etc.).
3.	Go to the extensions page.
4.	Click “Developer mode”.
5.	“Load unpacked extension”.
6.	Choose the directory you unpacked the .crx into.

##Firefox
Firefox will load the extension, but only after you give Github.com permission to install extensions:

1.	Click the lock icon to the left of the URL omnibox.
2.	Click the right-pointing arrow to go to the page info.
3.	Click “More Information”.
4.	Go to the “Permissions” tab.
5.	Set “Install Add-ons” to “Allow”

Now you *should* be able to install it in Firefox.


##Internet Explorer

I’ll get back to you on this one…
