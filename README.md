# Affil-A-Friend
Extension for Chrome, Firefox, IE using the Crossrider framework.

Whenever you are about to check out on Amazon, this extension reminds you to apply an Amazon Affiliate link so you can support your favorite podcast/blog/YouTube channel/whatever! Simply paste a valid Amazon Affiliate link (ie, an amazon URL containing a tag such as `tag=bob-20`) into the sidebar, and it will be applied to the current session as well as saved for use in the future.

DISCLAIMER: The source code that I've written is published here, but compiling a runnable version of the extension from it is pretty well out of the question due to the way in which Crossrider hosts/serves the project code.

The following link should detect your browser and allow you to download Affil-a-friend for Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer, BUT it will definitely trigger your browser's "END OF THE WORLD MALWARE" alarm:

##Chrome Installation

Chrome won’t let you directly install the .crx file that you get through the download link, but it will let you install it manually by jumping through a few hoops:

1.	Download the .crx extension file.
2.	Unpack it with your archive management program of choice (7-Zip, WinRAR, etc.).
3.	Go to the extensions page.
4.	Click “Developer mode”.
5.	“Load unpacked extension”.
6.	Choose the directory you unpacked the .crx into.

##Firefox Installation

Firefox will load the extension, but only after you give Github.com permission to install extensions:

1.	Click the lock icon to the left of the URL omnibox.
2.	Click the right-pointing arrow to go to the page info.
3.	Click “More Information”.
4.	Go to the “Permissions” tab.
5.	Set “Install Add-ons” to “Allow”

Now you *should* be able to install it in Firefox.


##Internet Explorer Installation

I’ll get back to you on this one…
